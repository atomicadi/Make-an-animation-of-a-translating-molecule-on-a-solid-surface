# Make-an-animation-of-a-translating-molecule-on-a-solid-surface
1. To animated a translating molecule on a soild surface, here in this fortran code, the animation will be performed by using the VMD software.
2. Here, the code open the each file and read all the lines and marge it in a output file.
3. Next, for animation, the newly generated out put file will be opend by VMD and animation will be performed.
4. In this code, the transalated output files, which are generated by the Translate-molecule-on-solid-surface code, will be moved into the new respective directory which are generated by using this command  (call 'mkdir' and 'mv').
